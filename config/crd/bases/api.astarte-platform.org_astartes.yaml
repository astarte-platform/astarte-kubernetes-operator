                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                          non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using
                                          this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                          compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                          DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                          automatically if one of them is empty and
                                          the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                          non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using
                                          this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                              \n Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the
                              pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring

                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using

                              if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see
                              the documentation of the driver for more information.

                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:

                                          non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using

                              \n Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the
                              pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring

                              the documentation of the driver for more information.

                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using

                                      with the highest sum are the most preferred.

                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                          non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using
                                          this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                          object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding
                                          will only succeed if the type of the specified
                                          object matches some installed volume populator
                                          or dynamic provisioner. This field will
                                          replace the functionality of the DataSource
                                          field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                          they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                          DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                          automatically if one of them is empty and
                                          the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                          differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                          * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                          types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                          non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                          values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using
                                          this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
