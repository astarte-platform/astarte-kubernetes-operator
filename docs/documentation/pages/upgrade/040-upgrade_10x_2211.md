# Upgrade v1.0.x-v22.11.x

This page describes the required steps to upgrade your Astarte cluster from `v1.0.x` to
`v22.11.x`. Your Astarte instance will **not** need to be upgraded.
The change in the versioning scheme of the Astarte Operator is meant to better keep up with
Kubernetes release cycle (see the [related
issue](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-kubernetes-operator/issues/306) for more
information).

Starting from the Astarte Operator `v22.11` release, the old `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha1`
APIs are deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

In the following, the upgrade path is described.

The upcoming sections will cover the following topics:
- upgrading the Astarte Operator,
- making sure that the Astarte, AstarteVoyagerIngress and Flow CR are stored using `v1alpha2` API
  version,
- upgrading the Astarte, AstarteVoyagerIngress and Flow CRDs to have only `v1alpha2` as storage
  version.

Before starting with the upgrade procedure it is strongly advised to [backup your Astarte
resources](095-advanced_operations.html#backup-your-astarte-resources).

## Upgrade Astarte Operator
The Astarte Operator upgrade procedure is handled by Helm.

The current section assumes that the Operator's chart landing version is `v22.11.x`. It is **your
responsibility** referencing the proper `v22.11.x` chart using the `--version` flag when running
`helm` commands.

Please, make sure that the values you set for both the Operator's name and namespace match the
naming you already adopted when installing the Operator. A wrong naming can lead to a malfunctioning
Astarte cluster.

For standard deployments the following variables should be ok. However, it is your responsibility
checking that the values you set are consistent with your setup:

```bash
export ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME=astarte-operator
export ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAMESPACE=astarte-operator
export ASTARTE_OP_CHART_VERSION=<22.11.x>
```

Update your local Helm charts:
```bash
helm repo update
```

To upgrade the Operator use the dedicated `helm upgrade` command:
```bash
helm upgrade $ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAME astarte/astarte-operator -n $ASTARTE_OP_RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --version $ASTARTE_OP_CHART_VERSION
```

The optional `--version` switch allows to specify the version to upgrade to - when not specified,
the latest version will be fetched and used.

By design, Astarte Operator's Helm charts cannot univocally be mapped to Operator's releases in a
one-to-one relationship. However each chart is tied to a specific Operator's version, which is user
configurable.

Therefore, upgrading a chart leads to an Operator's upgrade if and only if the Operator's tag
referenced by the chart is changed. You can check the Operator's tag bound to the chart simply
running:

```bash
helm show values astarte/astarte-operator
```

As usual, you can use the `--version` flag to point to a specific chart version.

## Make sure Astarte is stored using the `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2` apiVersion

To do so, simply edit the Astarte resource in the cluster. Open the yaml file describing the Astarte
resource with:
```bash
kubectl edit astarte -n astarte
```

Find the `apiVersion` field in the Astarte Spec section and change it (if needed) to
`api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`.

After having done this, you Astarte CR will look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2
kind: Astarte
...
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
```

Once the yaml file is applied, the Operator will take over ensuring the reconciliation of your
Astarte instance. This will in turn change the version in which the Astarte CR is stored in
Kubernetes to `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`.


## Make sure Flow is stored using the `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2` apiVersion

To do so, simply edit the Flow resource in the cluster.  
Open the yaml file describing the Flow resource with:
```bash
kubectl edit flow -n astarte
```

Find the `apiVersion` field in the Flow Spec section and change it (if needed) to
`api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`.

After having done this, your Flow CR will look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2
kind: Flow
...
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
```

Once the yaml file is applied, the Operator will take over ensuring the reconciliation of your
Flow instance. This will in turn change the version in which the Flow CR is stored in
Kubernetes to `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`.

## Make sure the apiVersion of AstarteVoyagerIngress is `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`

**The AstarteVoyagerIngress is deprecated and will be removed starting from Astarte Operator
v23.5.0.**
**Please consider [switching to the new
AstarteDefaultIngress](066-migrate_to_astartedefaultingress.html).**

If you already have dropped the AstarteVoyagerIngress, you can skip this section.

To do so, simply edit the AstarteVoyagerIngress resource in the cluster.
Open the yaml file describing the AstarteVoyagerIngress resource with:
```bash
kubectl edit avi -n astarte
```

Find the `apiVersion` field in the AstarteVoyagerIngress Spec section and change it (if needed) to
`api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`.

After having done this, your AstarteVoyagerIngress CR will look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2
kind: AstarteVoyagerIngress
...
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
```

Once the yaml file is applied, the Operator will take over ensuring the reconciliation of your
AstarteVoyagerIngress instance. This will in turn change the version in which the
AstarteVoyagerIngress CR is stored in Kubernetes to `api.astarte-platform.org/v1alpha2`.

## Upgrade the CRDs to the new storage version
This step is handled by [`astartectl`](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astartectl). Ensure that
`astartectl` is installed on your machine and its version is at least `>= v22.11.00`.

Performing the actual upgrade is as simple as executing the following command:

```bash
$ astartectl cluster instances migrate storage-version
```

If an error occurs during the migration procedure, changes made by `migrate storage-version` will be
reverted, so that you can make sure of having performed all necessary steps described in this page
before trying again.

### What happens under the hood?

When invoking the `migrate storage-version` command, `astartectl` interacts with your Astarte
cluster and retrieves the Astarte, Flow and AVI CRDs which are installed. Then, it checks that the
CRDs are in a state consistent with the migration step it needs to perform, i.e. that each one of
them has both `v1alpha1` and `v1alpha2` as `storedVersions`. For example, your Astarte CRD will look
like this:

```yaml
name: astartes.api.astarte-platform.org
...
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
  storedVersions:
  - v1alpha1
  - v1alpha2
```

Then, `astartectl` simply shrinks the `status.storedVersions` field to just `v1alpha2`.
After having run the command, your Astarte CRD will look like this:
```yaml
name: astartes.api.astarte-platform.org
...
spec:
  ...
status:
  ...
  storedVersions:
  - v1alpha2
```

If one of the previous tasks is not successful, the migration logic is reverted as not to leave
your cluster in a broken state.
