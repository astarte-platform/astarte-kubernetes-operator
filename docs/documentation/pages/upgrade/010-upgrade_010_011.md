# Upgrade v0.10-v0.11

The upgrade procedure for both Astarte and Astarte Operator `v0.10` is handled by `astartectl`,
which is the tool to be employed to upgrade from `v0.10` to `v0.11`.

## Upgrade Astarte Operator
To upgrade the Operator, use the dedicated `upgrade-operator` command:

```bash
astartectl cluster upgrade-operator
```

This command upgrades the Operator to the last `v0.11.x` version available. However, for specific and
non-standard use cases, the `--version` switch is provided to allow the user to specify the version
to upgrade to. 

We highly encourage you to follow the standard approach and to land to the last `v0.11.x` version
available.

## Upgrade Astarte
To upgrade Astarte use the dedicated command:

```bash
astartectl cluster instances upgrade <your-astarte-release-name>
```

The command upgrades your Astarte instance to the last `0.11.x` version available. The Astarte
version to upgrade to can be set by the user. Please, see `astartectl cluster instances upgrade
--help` for further details.

Unless you have specific reasons, it is highly recommended upgrading Astarte to the last `0.11`
version available.
