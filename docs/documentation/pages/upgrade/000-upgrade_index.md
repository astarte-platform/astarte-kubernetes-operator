# Upgrade Procedures

The procedure for upgrading Astarte and Astarte Operator depends on the version you want to upgrade
from.

After Astarte Operator v1.0.x, a change in the versioning scheme was introduced.
This does **not** have any impact on the Astarte version. Refer to the
[related issue](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-kubernetes-operator/issues/306)
for more information.
