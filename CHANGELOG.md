  [SemVer](https://semver.org). This is the last release following the SemVer scheme.
  See https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-kubernetes-operator/issues/306.

  for the exposed broker service.

### Changed
- Add Kubernetes 1.22 and 1.23 to the supported list. Remove tests for Kubernetes 1.19.
- Upgrade OperatorSDK to v1.9.0.
- Update CFSSL to 1.5.0-astarte.3.

## [1.0.2] - 2022-04-01

## [1.0.1] - 2021-12-17
### Changed
- Implement DUP scalability correctly by distributing multiple deployments and managing queue
  allocation over different replicas.
- Make tests and CI work on Kubernetes 1.20+
- Add Kubernetes 1.19, 1.20 and 1.21 to the supported list. Deprecate anything < 1.18

- Use kustomize v3.8.7.
- Drop support for Kubernetes < v1.19.

### Added
- Add `SSLListener` field to handle SSL termination at VerneMQ level. Defaults to `false`. Enabling
  this feature requires the installation of certificates within a Kubernetes secret.
- Add `SSLListenerCertSecretName` field to reference the name of the secret containing the
  certificate that will be used for handling SSL termination at VerneMQ level. The referenced
  secret must be present in the same namespace in which Astarte resides. This field is parsed only
  if `SSLListener` is set to true.
- Add `manualMaintenanceMode`, which pauses reconciliation for an Astarte resource and enables manual
  intervention.
- Add AstarteDefaultIngress type.
- Add validating and mutating webhooks for AstarteDefaultIngress.

### Fixed
- Fix bug that prevented the Astarte controller from deleting collections of deployments.

### Changed
- Deploy Flow only if explicitly requested. If you have an existing deployment, set `deploy: true`
  in the flow component before upgrading if you want to keep it deployed.
- When computing the cluster health, neglect all the Astarte components which are not to be deployed
  (i.e. replicas is set to 0 or deploy is false).

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2021-03-26
### Changed

- Starting with Astarte 1.0.0, CFSSL by default doesn't use a Database instead of using SQLite.
- CFSSL is now deployed as a Deployment, and no longer requires a Persistent Volume. This also
  means SQLite is no longer supported as a Database.

- Enable multi-group layout.
- Upgrade apiextensions to v1.
- Add v1alpha2 CRDs.
- Use Go 1.15.x by default

### Changed
- Force deployment strategy to Recreate for DUP and TE, overriding user preferences

### Changed
- Default Trigger Engine's deployment strategy to Recreate
- Default DUP's deployment strategy to Recreate (fixes #152)

  main `astarte` keyspace upon cluster initialization (#83)

  when performing the request

### Changed
- All `/metrics` endpoints are no longer exposed by default

## [0.11.0-beta.1]
### Added
- Added support for multi-queue Data Updater Plant and VerneMQ plugin. When migrating from single-queue deployments,

is empty, replace Data Updater Plant with the new version and bring VerneMQ back up to start publishing on the new queues.
- Molecule-based CI
- Added Finalizers upon Astarte deletion
